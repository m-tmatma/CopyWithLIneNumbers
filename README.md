# CopyWithLineNumbers
Copy With Line Numbers Visual Studio Plugin

* This is a plugin for Visaul Studio which copies with line numbers to the clipboard.
* The solution and project file are for Visual Studio 2017 Community.
* But it works on Visual Studio 2015 and 2017.
* I tested only community edition, so if it doen't work on Professinal and Enterprise, let me know or send a pull request.

This is an example text which is sent to clipboard.
